    Now that you agree that what you think is important then you will also realize that avoiding unwanted influences and using your abiltiy to think regularty are also vital. Which leads us to <br>

                    "Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide, is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."
                </li>
                <li>
                     “Privacy is the fountainhead of all other rights. Freedom of speech doesn't have a lot of meaning if you can't have a quiet space. A space within yourself, within your mind, within the community of your friends, within your home, to decide what it is you actually want to say.”
                </li>
                <li>
                    “Privacy isn't about something to hide. Privacy is about something to protect. And that's who you are. That's what you believe in. That's who you want to become. Privacy is the right to the self. Privacy is what gives you the ability to share with the world who you are on your own terms.”
                </li>

            Move ahead only if you agree. If you don't, No worries. It's nothing to aspire to.
