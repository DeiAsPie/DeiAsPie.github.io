---

Brave Browser has some of the best privacy defaults and includes a built-in content blocker. Brave is built upon the Chromium web browser project, so it should feel familiar and have minimal website compatibility issues.

**Key Features:**
- Blocks ads and trackers by default
- Built on Chromium for compatibility
- Brave Shields for enhanced privacy protection
- Optional Brave Rewards system
- Tor browsing mode in private windows
- HTTPS Everywhere built-in

**Recommended for:** Users who want privacy without sacrificing website compatibility, especially for banking and other services that require identification.
