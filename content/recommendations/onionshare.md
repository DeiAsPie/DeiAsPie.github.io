OnionShare is an open-source tool that lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size. It works by starting a web server accessible as a Tor onion service, with an unguessable URL that you can share with the recipients to download or send files.

**Key Features:**
- Share files of any size anonymously
- No file size limits
- Works through Tor for anonymity
- Temporary sharing - links expire after use
- No third-party servers involved
- Receive files anonymously as well
- Self-hosted - runs on your own computer

**Use Cases:** Secure file sharing for journalists, activists, or anyone who needs anonymous file transfer.
