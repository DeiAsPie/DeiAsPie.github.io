---

Proton Authenticator is a standalone authenticator app from Proton that supports TOTP (Time-based One-Time Passwords) and modern passwordless authentication flows. It is designed to work well with Proton accounts and other services that support standard 2FA mechanisms.

Features

- TOTP for two-factor authentication
- Passwordless/Passkeys support where available
- Cross-device sync through Proton (if enabled)
- Simple, privacy-focused UI and secure storage of secrets

Notes

Authenticator apps add a strong layer of security over passwords alone. If you use Proton services, Proton Authenticator integrates smoothly; otherwise standard TOTP apps like Authy, FreeOTP, or Aegis are good alternatives depending on your threat model and need for backups/sync.
