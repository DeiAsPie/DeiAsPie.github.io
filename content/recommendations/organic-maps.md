Notes

Organic Maps intentionally omits some features found in larger map platforms, such as satellite imagery, street view, and real-time traffic — but this is a trade-off for privacy and offline capability. It meets common minimum privacy criteria: open-source code, no account requirement, and core offline functionality.
