# Your Digital Shield Arsenal üî∞

Welcome to the complete archive of privacy-focused tools and services I recommend. These are battle-tested alternatives to mainstream services that respect your rights and put you back in control.

## Important Guidelines

**In General:**
- **Stay away from social media.** When really necessary, use a private messenger suggested below.
- If you can't remove it later, then don't put it online.
- **Avoid unauthorized access:**
  - Use a password manager to set strong and complex passwords
  - Use encryption whenever possible
  - Don't leave your devices unattended
  - Don't plug in random stuff in your devices
  - Disable Bluetooth, WiFi, etc, when not required. Turn on Airplane mode as much as possible
  - Be very stingy with the permissions you grant to users or apps on your network or devices

## Platform Priorities

**Desktop vs Mobile:** Desktop operating systems were [not designed with security in mind](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2017/03/05/secure-computing-for-journalists/), so **try avoiding desktops as much as possible and stick to an updated mobile device** preferably running one of the OS recommended here.

**Custom ROMs Warning:** Don't fall for flashing custom ROMs just for the sake of De-Googling your Android device as doing so would seriously ruin your Security and thus, your Privacy. Use the recommended operating system here or stick to the stock ROM being updated regularly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Rule

**DO NOT USE A DEVICE IN ABSENCE OF REGULAR UPDATES**
