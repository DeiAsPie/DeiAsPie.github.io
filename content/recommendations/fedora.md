Fedora is an operating system developed as a community project and sponsored by Red Hat (a subsidiary of IBM). It prefers Flatpak as a dominant packaging style. It follows a semi-rolling release cycle. Each Fedora release is supported for one year, with a new version released every 6 months.

**Key Features:**

- Very up to date both in terms of applications and the Linux kernel itself
- Excellent for beginners transitioning from Windows or macOS
- Strong focus on free and open-source software

**Immutable Variants:** If you are worried that you many unintentionally break your system, then have a look at [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) (uses GNOME) or [Fedora Kinoite](https://kinoite.fedoraproject.org/) (uses KDE). Both are immutable variants of Fedora with a strong focus on container workflows.
