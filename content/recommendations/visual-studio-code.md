summary: "A fast, extensible code editor with an unmatched ecosystem."
---

VS Code is my daily driver. Itâ€™s fast, extensible, and has an ecosystem of extensions that covers almost any workflow.

Highlights:

- Excellent IntelliSense and debugging.
- Integrated terminal, Git, and GitHub.
- Huge marketplace of extensions.

Best for developers and power users who want a flexible and modern editor.
