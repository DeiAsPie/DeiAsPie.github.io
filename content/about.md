Hi, I'm DeiAsPie. This is my corner of the web where I share privacy-focused tools, services, and knowledge that can help you reclaim your digital sovereignty.

## My Mission

In an era where surveillance capitalism dominates and our personal data is treated as commodity, I believe in empowering individuals with knowledge and tools to protect their privacy and security. This site curates battle-tested alternatives to mainstream services that respect your rights and put you back in control.

## Why Privacy Matters

Privacy isn't about having something to hide - it's about having something to protect. Your thoughts, your relationships, your personal growth, and your right to be yourself without constant monitoring and manipulation.

As Edward Snowden said: *"Arguing that you don't care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide, is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say."*

## What I Recommend

Every tool and service featured here has been carefully evaluated based on:

- **Privacy by design** - Built with user privacy as a core principle
- **Open source** when possible - Transparency through code
- **No tracking** - Services that don't spy on their users
- **Strong encryption** - Your data should be yours alone
- **Decentralization** - Avoiding single points of failure and control

## My Philosophy

**DO NOT USE A DEVICE IN ABSENCE OF REGULAR UPDATES**

Security is a process, not a product. The recommendations here prioritize tools that are actively maintained, regularly updated, and have strong security track records.

I believe in making privacy accessible. You don't need to be a security expert to protect yourself - you just need the right tools and guidance.
