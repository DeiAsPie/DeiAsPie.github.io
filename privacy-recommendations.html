But no matter which OS you choose beware that the desktop operating systems were <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2017/03/05/secure-computing-for-journalists/">not designed with security in mind,</a> so <strong>try avoiding desktops as much as possible and sticking to an updated mobile device</strong> preferably running one of the OS recommended here.</em>

It prefers <a href="https://www.flatpak.org/">flatpak</a> as a dominant packaging style. It follows a semi-rolling release cycle. Each Fedora release is supported for one year, with a new version released every 6 months. <em>It tends to be very up to date both in terms of applications and the Linux kernel itself.</em> If you are worried that you many unintentionally break your system, then have a look at <a href="https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Silverblue</a> (uses GNOME) or <a href="https://kinoite.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Kinoite</a> (uses KDE). Both of which are immutable variants of Fedora with a strong focus on container workflows.
