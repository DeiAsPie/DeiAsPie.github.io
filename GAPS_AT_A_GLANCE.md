# Industry Best Practices Gaps - Quick Reference

## Overall Assessment: 8/10 ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Your project is **production-ready** with excellent practices in testing, security, and performance. Main gaps are in **release management and developer workflow automation**.

---

## 🟢 What You're Doing Well (95%+ Alignment)

✅ **Testing** - Playwright E2E, Axe accessibility, Lighthouse CI  
✅ **CI/CD** - GitHub Actions with multiple quality gates  
✅ **Code Quality** - ESLint (strict), Prettier, content validation  
✅ **Performance** - CSS/image budgets, build monitoring  
✅ **Security** - Hugo hardened, CSP, XSS prevention, Dependabot  
✅ **Accessibility** - WCAG 2.2 focus, ARIA, keyboard nav  
✅ **Setup** - EditorConfig, .gitignore, clear structure

## 🔴 Critical Gaps (Must Fix)

| Gap | Status | Effort | Priority |
|-----|--------|--------|----------|
| **Semantic Versioning** | ❌ Missing CHANGELOG, no version tags | 2-3h | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Conventional Commits** | ❌ No commit format enforced | 1h | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Git Hooks** | ❌ No husky/lint-staged pre-commit | 1.5h | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **CONTRIBUTING.md** | ❌ Missing guidelines | 1h | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **SECURITY.md** | ❌ Missing vulnerability process | 0.5h | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **.nvmrc** | ❌ Node version not specified | 0.1h | 🔴 CRITICAL |

---

## 🟡 Medium Priority Gaps

- **CSS Linting** - stylelint not configured (1-2h)
- **ADRs** - Design decisions not documented (2-3h)
- **Test Coverage** - No coverage metrics (2-3h)
- **.env.example** - Environment vars not documented (0.5h)

---

## 🟢 Low Priority Gaps

- .gitattributes (5 min)
- Prettier config expansion (30 min)
- Docker support (optional, 1-2h)
- Documentation reorganization (1-2h)

## Quick Wins - Do This Week

```
.nvmrc                          ✏️  Create file: 22.11.0
CONTRIBUTING.md                 📝  Onboarding guide  
SECURITY.md                     🔒  Vulnerability reporting
.gitattributes                  📋  Line ending config
.env.example                    🔧  Environment vars
```

**Time: 1-2 hours total | Impact: High**

## Strategic Work - Next Sprint

```
Conventional Commits            💬  Format: feat(scope): message
husky + lint-staged             🪝  Pre-commit hooks
Semantic Versioning             📦  semver.org + CHANGELOG
CSS Linting (stylelint)         🎨  Style validation
Architecture Decision Records   📚  docs/adr/ folder
```

**Time: 8-10 hours total | Impact: Major**

---

## The Path Forward

```
Before:  8/10 ✓ Production-ready but missing release management
↓
After Quick Wins:    8.5/10 ✓ Security & collaboration improved
↓
After Strategic:     9.5/10 ✓ Industry-aligned best practices
```

## Key Issue: Release Management

Your project has **zero implementation** of:
- ❌ Semantic versioning (stuck at v1.0.0)
- ❌ Release tags in git
- ❌ Changelog tracking
- ❌ Release automation

This breaks:
- User ability to identify breaking changes
- Changelog generation
- Dependency management tools
- Contributor clarity on versions

**Fix:** Implement semver.org + keepachangelog.com with release-please automation

---

## Key Issue: Developer Workflow

No pre-commit validation means:
- ❌ Linting errors only caught in CI (5-10 min feedback)
- ❌ Wasted CI resources
- ❌ Long feedback loop discourages good practices

**Fix:** Add husky + lint-staged for instant local feedback

---

## Key Issue: Contributor Onboarding

Missing:
- ❌ CONTRIBUTING.md (GitHub shows this to potential contributors)
- ❌ Commit conventions (no clear guidance)
- ❌ Vulnerability reporting (SECURITY.md missing)

**Fix:** Create 3 markdown files with clear guidelines

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Read** BEST_PRACTICES_ANALYSIS.md for complete context
2. **Start with** 5 quick-win files (1-2 hours)
3. **Then tackle** conventional commits + husky (2-3 hours)
4. **Finally implement** semantic versioning (2-3 hours)

**Total effort:** ~12-15 hours for 9.5/10 alignment
