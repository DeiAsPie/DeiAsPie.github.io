# Codebase Improvements - Industry Best Practices Implementation

## Date: October 6, 2025

## Summary of Changes

Based on research from Hugo documentation, WCAG 2.2 guidelines, and modern web development best practices, the following improvements have been implemented:

---

## ðŸ”’ Security Enhancements

### 1. Hugo Goldmark Renderer - Disabled Unsafe HTML
**File:** `hugo.toml`
**Change:** Set `unsafe = false` in Goldmark renderer
**Rationale:**
- Following Hugo security best practices to prevent XSS vulnerabilities
- Raw HTML in markdown should be avoided; use shortcodes for better control
- Aligns with WCAG security model distinguishing trusted templates from untrusted content

### 2. Added Hugo Security Configuration
**File:** `hugo.toml`
**Added:**
```toml
[security]
  enableInlineShortcodes = false
  [security.exec]
    allow = ['^(dart-)?sass(-embedded)?$', '^go$', '^npx$', '^postcss$']
    osEnv = ['^HUGO_', '^CI$']
  [security.funcs]
    getenv = ['^HUGO_', '^CI$']
  [security.http]
    methods = ['GET', 'HEAD']
    urls = ['.*']
```
**Rationale:**
- Restricts external command execution
- Controls environment variable access
- Follows Hugo's defense-in-depth security model
- Prevents arbitrary OS command execution

### 3. Enhanced Content Security Policy (CSP)
**File:** `themes/curated/layouts/partials/head.html`
**Added directives:**
- `base-uri 'self'` - Prevents base tag hijacking
- `form-action 'self'` - Restricts form submission targets
- `upgrade-insecure-requests` - Automatically upgrades HTTP to HTTPS

**Rationale:**
- Follows OWASP CSP best practices
- Protects against clickjacking and injection attacks
- Enforces HTTPS usage

### 4. Improved Service Worker Caching Strategy
**File:** `static/sw.js`
**Changes:**
- Added version management (`CACHE_VERSION`)
- Implemented cache cleanup on activation
- Changed to network-first strategy with cache fallback
- Added origin check to skip cross-origin requests
- Implemented `skipWaiting()` and `clients.claim()` for immediate activation

**Rationale:**
- Better cache invalidation and versioning
- Prevents stale content serving
- More resilient offline experience
- Follows PWA best practices

## â™¿ Accessibility Improvements

### 1. Added Goldmark Parser Attributes
**File:** `hugo.toml`
**Added:**
```toml
[markup.goldmark.parser.attribute]
  block = true
  title = true
```
**Rationale:**
- Enables block-level attribute syntax in markdown
- Allows adding ARIA attributes and custom IDs
- Facilitates better accessibility control in content

### 2. Enhanced Viewport and Color Scheme Meta Tags
**File:** `themes/curated/layouts/partials/head.html`
**Added:**
- `<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=no" />` - Prevents unwanted phone number detection
- `<meta name="color-scheme" content="light dark" />` - Signals dark mode support to browsers

**Rationale:**
- Improves user experience on mobile devices
- Better dark mode integration with browser UI
- Follows WCAG 2.2 color adaptation guidelines

### 3. Created Accessibility Utilities Module
**File:** `assets/js/a11y-utils.js`
**Features:**
- `createFocusTrap()` - Traps focus within modals/menus
- `announceToScreenReader()` - Live region announcements
- Proper keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab handling)

**Rationale:**
- Follows WCAG 2.2 Success Criterion 2.1.1 (Keyboard accessible)
- Implements ARIA best practices for focus management
- Improves screen reader UX with live announcements

### 4. Enhanced Mobile Menu Accessibility
**File:** `assets/js/init-ui.js`
**Improvements:**
- Added focus trap when menu opens
- Screen reader announcements for menu state changes
- Proper `aria-hidden` attribute management
- Returns focus to toggle button on close

**Rationale:**
- WCAG 2.2 SC 2.4.3 (Focus Order)
- WCAG 2.2 SC 4.1.3 (Status Messages) via live regions
- Follows WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices for menu buttons

## âš¡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Added Build Statistics
**File:** `hugo.toml`
**Added:**
```toml
[build]
  buildStats = { enable = true }
  cacheBusters = [
    { source = "assets/.*\\.js$", target = "js" },
    { source = "assets/.*\\.css$", target = "css" }
  ]
```
**Rationale:**
- Enables performance monitoring
- Better cache invalidation for static assets
- Follows Hugo performance best practices

### 2. Service Worker Type Definitions
**File:** `static/sw.d.ts`
**Purpose:** TypeScript definitions for service worker context
**Rationale:**
- Improves developer experience
- Type safety for service worker development
- Better IDE support

## ðŸ“‹ Recommendations for Future Implementation

### High Priority:
1. **Subresource Integrity for External Resources**
   - Already implemented for local assets via `fingerprint`
   - Consider adding SRI for any external fonts/scripts

2. **Responsive Image Consolidation**
   - The `responsive-image.html` partial is well-implemented
   - Ensure all templates use it consistently (already done in card.html)

3. **Add Playwright E2E Tests**
   - Test theme toggle functionality
   - Test mobile menu focus trap
   - Test keyboard navigation

### Medium Priority:
1. **HTML/Markdown Linting**
   - Add `markdownlint-cli2` for content quality
   - Validate heading hierarchy automatically

2. **CSP Reporting Endpoint**
   - Implement `report-uri` or `report-to` directive
   - Monitor CSP violations in production

3. **Design Tokens**
   - Introduce CSS custom properties for colors/spacing
   - Improves maintainability and theming

### Low Priority:
1. **Extended Hugo Caching**
   - Cache `.hugo_build.lock` in CI
   - Add parallel job execution

2. **Editor Configuration**
   - Add `.editorconfig`
   - VS Code tasks for common commands

## ðŸ§ª Testing Recommendations

Run the following to verify changes:

```bash
# Build the site
hugo --gc --minify

# Check for errors
hugo check

# Run accessibility tests (if configured)
npm run test:a11y

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```

## Notes

All changes maintain backward compatibility and follow the existing code style. The improvements focus on:
- **Security hardening** (CSP, Hugo security config, renderer safety)
- **Accessibility enhancement** (WCAG 2.2 compliance, ARIA best practices)
- **Performance optimization** (caching strategies, build configuration)
- **Developer experience** (type definitions, better documentation)
